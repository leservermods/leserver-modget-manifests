# Example Modget Manifest Repository
This is an example manifest repository for [**Modget**](https://github.com/ReviversMC/modget-minecraft), an open source Minecraft mod package manager. You can use this template as a starting point for building your own repository, which you can then use ingame via the `/modget repos add <repo URL>` command.

More information on how to structure and maintain such a repository can be found over at our [official manifest repository](https://github.com/ReviversMC/modget-manifests).
